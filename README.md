# Go Distributed System (Leader Election + Messaging)

A lightweight distributed system demo implemented in Go. Each node runs as a container, participates in leader election, and communicates with other nodes for message passing.

## 🚀 Features
- Implemented in Go using goroutines and channels.
- Leader election logic inspired by Raft (simplified).
- Broadcast messaging across nodes.
- Containerized and deployed to Kubernetes with multiple replicas.
- Logs show leader election events and message propagation.
